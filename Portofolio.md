**NOTE:** I appologize I didn't prepare any attractive proper portofolio documents.

Here my personal Github account that I use for both hobby and freelance works since 2014:

And here my last workplace Github account which I contribute in past 4 years as academic research assistant.

I hope this is sufficient for this time and I'm willing to provide more documents or information if necessary.
